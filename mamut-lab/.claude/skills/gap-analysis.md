- Missing theoretical frameworks

### 2. Methodology Gaps
Limitations in current approaches
- Inadequate measurement methods
- Unvalidated assumptions
- Missing benchmarks

### 3. Technology Gaps
What cannot yet be built or achieved
- Performance limitations
- Missing components
- Integration challenges

### 4. Application Gaps
Where solutions haven't been applied
- New use cases
- Underserved markets
- Scaling challenges

### 5. Standardization Gaps
Missing or inadequate standards
- No interoperability specs
- Incomplete test procedures
- Conflicting standards
