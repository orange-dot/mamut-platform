# Skill: prior-art

Search for prior art in patents and publications. Critical for patent applications.

## When to Use

- Before filing patent applications
- During invention disclosure preparation
- To assess novelty of ideas
- For freedom-to-operate analysis
- Competitive intelligence

## Search Scope

### Patent Databases
| Database | Coverage | URL |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Google Patents | Worldwide | patents.google.com |
| USPTO | US patents & applications | patft.uspto.gov |
| Espacenet | EP, WO, national | worldwide.espacenet.com |
| WIPO PatentScope | PCT applications | patentscope.wipo.int |
| Lens.org | Patents + scholarly | lens.org |

### Non-Patent Literature (NPL)
| Source | Type |
|--------|------|
| IEEE Xplore | Technical papers |
| Google Scholar | Academic papers |
| arXiv | Preprints |
| YouTube/Vimeo | Product demos |
| Trade publications | Industry news |

## Search Strategy

### 1. Claim Decomposition
Break invention into elements:
```
Invention: Modular EV charger with hot-swap
├── Element A: Modular power unit
├── Element B: Hot-swap mechanism
├── Element C: Distributed control
└── Element D: Fleet optimization
```

### 2. Keyword Development
| Element | Primary Terms | Synonyms | IPC/CPC Classes |
|---------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| A | modular charger | scalable, building-block | H02J 7/00 |
| B | hot-swap | hot-plug, live-swap | H02J 7/02 |
| C | distributed control | decentralized, multi-agent | G05B 19/00 |
| D | fleet optimization | scheduling, load balancing | G06Q 10/00 |

### 3. Search Queries
```
# Google Patents
(modular OR scalable) AND ("electric vehicle" OR EV) AND (charger OR EVSE)

# USPTO
ACLM/(modular AND charger) AND SPEC/(electric vehicle)

# Espacenet
ti=(modular charger) AND cl=H02J7
```

## Output Format
