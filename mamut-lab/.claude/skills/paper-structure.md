# Skill: paper-structure

Structure documents following academic conventions. Essential for publication readiness.

## When to Use

- Converting technical docs to papers
- Organizing research findings
- Preparing grant proposals
- Structuring technical reports
- Reviewing document organization

## Standard Structures

### IMRaD (Scientific Papers)
```
1. Introduction
   - Context/background
   - Problem statement
   - Contribution summary

2. Methods
   - Experimental setup
   - Procedures
   - Analysis methods

3. Results
   - Findings (no interpretation)
   - Data presentation
   - Statistical analysis

4. Discussion
   - Interpretation
   - Comparison to prior work
   - Limitations
   - Future work

5. Conclusion
   - Summary of contribution
   - Key takeaways
```

### Content Mapping
| Recommended Section | Current Location | Action |
|--------------------|------------------|--------|
| 1. Introduction | Lines 45-60 | Expand |
| 2.1 Related Work | Lines 12-44 | Move |
| 3.1 Architecture | Lines 89-120 | Keep |

## MISSING ELEMENTS

### Critical (Must Add)
1. **Contributions statement** - List 3-5 specific contributions
2. **Evaluation section** - Quantitative validation
3. **Limitations** - Honest assessment of scope

### Recommended
1. Related work comparison table
2. Future work section
3. Notation table

## SECTION TEMPLATES

### Introduction Template
```markdown
## 1. Introduction

[Opening hook - why this matters]

[Context - 1-2 paragraphs on background]

[Problem statement - specific gap being addressed]

[Approach summary - how you address the problem]

**Contributions.** This paper makes the following contributions:
- [Contribution 1]
- [Contribution 2]
- [Contribution 3]

[Paper organization - "Section 2 presents..."]
```

### Related Work Template
```markdown
## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 [Category 1]
[Discussion of prior work in category 1]

### 2.2 [Category 2]
[Discussion of prior work in category 2]

### 2.3 Comparison Summary
| Approach | Feature A | Feature B | Feature C |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Prior 1  | ✓         | ✗         | ✓         |
| Prior 2  | ✗         | ✓         | ✗         |
| **Ours** | **✓**     | **✓**     | **✓**     |
```

### Evaluation Template
```markdown
## 5. Evaluation

### 5.1 Experimental Setup
[Hardware, software, parameters]

## TRANSITIONS NEEDED

| From | To | Suggested Transition |
|------|-----|---------------------|
| Intro | Background | "Before presenting our approach, we review..." |
| Background | Design | "Building on these foundations, we now present..." |
| Design | Implementation | "We implemented this design as follows..." |
| Results | Discussion | "These results demonstrate..." |
